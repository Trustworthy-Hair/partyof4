## Problem ##
  Traveling or moving is exciting but when you are new to a city, it's hard to find where to eat or people to eat with. There's nothing wrong with eating alone, but meals are a great social activity, so it'd be nice to be able to find people who would be willing to give you an open seat at their table.

  PartyOf4 is a social mobile app that lets users search for people around them with open seats at their tables or plan foodie excursions with others. Brief user profiles help when looking for people that you'd be interested in talking to. Yelp-powered restaurant searching lets you find a place and open up your table to others!
